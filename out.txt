1: @whitehouse #whgc The Space Program, it's ridiculous that 40+ years after we first landed on the Moon we have not been back in over 35 years
2: @whitehouse National broadband high speed Internet. Higher speeds for less cost across America.
3: @whitehouse Best bandwidth on the planet should be the USA's next Grand Challenge!  It will help Business and Education!
4: @whitehouse Follow Google's lead: 1Gbps internet across the nation.  100% penetration.  Net neutrality.  Become a leader of the web.  #whgc
5: @whitehouse alternative energy #whgc
6: @whitehouse we should make or children a priority & fix the broken school system Parents shouldn't have 2 fight 2 get kids help they deserve
7: get ready to tell @whitehouse what our next big technological achievement should be, on Twitter http://bit.ly/9Skuxk /via @ginatrapani #fb
8: The next Apollo program or human genome project? Which Grand Challenge our Nation should address: http://bit.ly/b1Fyq9 (via @whitehouse)
9: @whitehouse Grand Challenge? PAY OFF OUR DEBT.
10: @whitehouse The next big project should involve creating and harnessing a clean, sustainable energy source!
11: @whitehouse Either Aim for mankind to land on Mars by 2030 or America cut fossil fuel use by 50% by 2050.
12: @whitehouse Can't we find a way to turn nuclear waste into fuel for nuclear energy? It'd help solve the storage problem, too.
13: @whitehouse Return us to the Moon! It's time for a national program the entire country can rally around. Let's look to the future!
